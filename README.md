# About this project
## Uber Data Analysis with PySpark-SQL: Decoding Urban Mobility
This project harnesses the power of big data analytics to decode the intricate patterns of urban mobility through Uber's vast dataset. Leveraging PySpark-SQL, the Python API for Apache Spark's SQL module, we dive deep into ride-sharing dynamics, uncovering insights that shape our understanding of modern transportation trends.

By employing distributed computing techniques, this analysis tackles complex queries with efficiency, demonstrating the potency of PySpark in handling large-scale data operations. From peak hours and popular routes to driver performance and user behaviour, our exploration answers critical questions that could drive strategic decisions in the ride-sharing industry.

This project not only showcases technical proficiency in PySpark-SQL but also highlights the ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data, a crucial skill in the realm of data engineering. Through this analysis, we bridge the gap between big data technology and real-world business applications, providing a glimpse into the future of data-driven urban planning and transportation optimization.
